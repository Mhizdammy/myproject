# Analyze International Debt Statistics


In this project, I used SQL in a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to analyze international debt statistics on the external debt and financial flows for the worldâ€™s economies from 1970 to 2017 for the most reporting countries in order to draw conclusions. This dataset was originally collected to measure and monitor creditworthiness of its client. This project is going to use partial dataset to explore the debt statistics of developing countries and further analyze their economic conditions and their major loan purpose.
